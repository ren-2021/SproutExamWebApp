Before Starting the app
ToDo:
run: 
npm install --force
npm audit fix --force

If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.

I think the best improvement to be prioritize next is the error logging. It will help a lot in terms of debugging and also in developing new features.
We can make a table that handles logging of all the errors that will be catched by the system.
